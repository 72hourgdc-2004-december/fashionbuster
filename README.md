    Thanks for playing!


    CONTROLS:

    right and left-arrow - Walk right and left. :P
    Space - Jump, Lisa can jump two tiles high.
    Up-arrow - Stand in front of the shop you need the clothes, 
    		then press up-arrow to change the specific clothing you can get at this shop.

    Goal of the game is to be dressed better than Jane is, so find her in the level and then go 
    to each shop and equip yourself with the best clothes.The system is kind of like "rock paper scissor",
    e.g. hotpants beat skirt, skirt beats blazer and blazer beats hotpants. Just try it out.
    Have fun!
